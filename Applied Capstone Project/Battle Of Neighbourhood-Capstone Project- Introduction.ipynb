    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we go on a vacation, the biggest problem apart from deciding the location is to decide which places to visit and in which order to make most of the day. We all start browsing internet and noting all the venues or try to remember all the desinations. All this effort makes it long and hard, sometimes this work overwhelms the user and leads to procastination and the vacation never arrives. This project aims to help and avoid this confusion and reduce the efforts made to plan a holiday.\n",
